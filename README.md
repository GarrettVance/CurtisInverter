# CurtisInverter
Reflections in hyperbolic geometry correspond to inversion in a circle. Here is a DirectX D3D11 Windows 10 app to demonstrate a bit of circle inversion. This is a Visual Studio 2017 C++ project for Windows 10 to create a UWP application. This Visual Studio project has a dependency on The Microsoft DirectXTK library. You must install Microsoft DirectXTK for Windows 10 x86 prior to building the Inverter project in Visual Studio 2017. Tested only on Windows 10. 
This project was inspired by the CircleInvertor project by MrCurtis on github at https://github.com/MrCurtis/CircleInvertor.
